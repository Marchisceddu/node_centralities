    - **Small World**
- Compute various centrality measures:
  - **Katz centrality**  
  - **Exponential Subgraph centrality**  
  - **Degree centrality**  
  - **Closeness centrality**
  - **Betweeness centrality**
  - **Eigenvector centrality**
  - **Pagerank centrality**
- Interactive GUI with visualization and sortable results table.
